> Fun small project I made to learn more about Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare Pages, Fauna and Azure App Functions. I also used this project to participate in [Cloudflare's Developer Summer Challenge](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-summer-challenge/).

[Example report](https://perf-viewer.snoozing.dev/?report=4cfb44f1-272d-4b5a-8792-2f5cfd23e105)

## Things used
* Terraform for setting up Azure infrastructure
* Azure App Functions to deploy a Lighthouse instance that the Cloudflare Worker can make use of
* Fauna to store results and reports with, and to also have the ability to see previous reports 
* Cloudflare Workers for the main backend that's used by the frontend and sends calls between Fauna and Azure
* Cloudflare Pages for storing and hosting the static frontend
